# Renew Process
## Renew Instance
Upon expiry of monthly package instances, JD Cloud will retain your instances for 7 days; but these instances are unavailable during this period and will be completely deleted after 7 days; it is recommended to renew the instances before expiration to ensure their constant availability; configuration changes are not supported during renewal which can only extend the expiration time of instance.
