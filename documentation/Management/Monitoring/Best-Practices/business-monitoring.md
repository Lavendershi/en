## Daily Workload Monitoring
### Applicable Scenarios:
If users need to monitor their own business, they are allowed to monitor the running status and usage of resources through the monitoring pages of the purchased Cloud Service details pages and the monitoring pages of the Cloud Monitor module. At the same time, users are allowed to set alarm rules according to the characteristics of cloud resources.
