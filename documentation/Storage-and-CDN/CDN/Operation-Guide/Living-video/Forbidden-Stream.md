**Blocked Streaming**

When the pushing streaming content of the streamer is illegal, the customer can set the streaming name to block the streamer from pushing streaming at second level, and can ban the streamer from pushing streaming permanently or temporarily to ensure the legitimacy of the content; and the streamer can only push streaming again after the ban of his streaming is lifted.

The streaming block is mainly for the configuration of the pushing streaming domain name.
