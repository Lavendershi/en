# **Details for web attack protection rule**

JD Cloud provides three kinds of web attack protection modes, namely: loose, normal and strict, and the default configuration is normal mode.

Loose: You will be recommended to select loose mode when it is found that there are more false intercepts in normal mode.
Normal: Normal is default mode, and can protect most Web application attack requests.
Strict: You will be recommended to select strict mode when tighter protection for XSS, SQL injection and sensitive file is required.
